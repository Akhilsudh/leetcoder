My scratchbook for coding problems

## Some points taken
* Largest common prefix problem thoughts
  * Approach by sorting: Sorting the array of strings and using the first and the last (most dissimilar) strings only to figure out the largest common prefix.
  * Approach by Binary searching: Find the minimum length of the strings and apply the bisary search logic on the low mid and high values (based on the minimum length) on any string.
